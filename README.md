A 'C Software Rendered Game Engine'.

A game engine specifically designed for a fast paced 3D shooter game written in C. 

For now the game engine development is solely driven by necessity for the game, however, in the future, the game may
be split off as a separate project.

# TODO: Name for game.

TODO: I do like the name ScopeEngine but there is a game called scope already. I like the idea of scope creep and the
name being called scope.
