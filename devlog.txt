- Fixed heap corruption bug from CECS causing sporadic crash on startup.


14/9/25
- Refactored some parts of clipping and prepare_for_clipping
- Reimplemented UVs
- Realised that I've been prematurely optimising and working on stuff for absolutely no reason (ECS).
  From this point going forwards, I will be focusing on the development of the game, and the engine
  will be purely tied to the game. Any refactors or optimisations should come out of necessity.
- Fixed issue in CECS where wrong entity component is removed when removing a component.

15/9/25
- Fixed logic errors and crashes in CECS when moving entity archetype which was causing a crash when I removed a mesh
  instance and added a new one to another entity.
- Added Transform component to replace position,scale,rotation in
  MeshInstance. Refactored render system to use Transform component, ready
for starting physics implementation.

TODOS:
- Begin basic physics system.
- Reimplement shadows.
