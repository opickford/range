10/9/25
- Fixed heap corruption bug from CECS causing sporadic crash on startup.

14/9/25
- Refactored some parts of clipping and prepare_for_clipping
- Reimplemented UVs
- Realised that I've been prematurely optimising and working on stuff for absolutely no reason (ECS).
  From this point going forwards, I will be focusing on the development of the game, and the engine
  will be purely tied to the game. Any refactors or optimisations should come out of necessity.
- Fixed issue in CECS where wrong entity component is removed when removing a component.

15/9/25
- Fixed logic errors and crashes in CECS when moving entity archetype which was causing a crash when I removed a mesh
  instance and added a new one to another entity.
- Added Transform component to replace position,scale,rotation in
  MeshInstance. Refactored render system to use Transform component, ready
for starting physics implementation.

18/9/25
- Begin implementation of basic physics system, basic PhysicsData component and physics system using suvat equations.
- Refactor CECS ECS_add_component to return void* so we can remove redudant ECS_get_component after.

23/9/25
- Refactor CECS ECS_find_component_list -> ECS_get_component_list for simplicity.

24/9/25
- Optimise font rendering by transforming input atlas to be more cache friendly so that a single character is 
  continuous in memory. Remove padding from atlas to avoid wasting cache.

27/9/25
- Begin implementation of collision system.

29/9/25
- Implement Collider component with a CollisionShape tagged union to enable defining different shape interactions, 
  this essentially automatically allowed for multiple spheres to collide into each other with some temp hacked
  code in the narrow phase to just stop entities when they collide! Very cool to see and a good step forward.

03/10/25
- Begin CECS refactor of Systems -> Views

04/10/25
- Finish CECS refactor, implented lots archetype iterators, hide CHDS dependency, hid private/internal functionality,
  this can now be version 1.0.0 of the CECS lib. Implement 'exclude' feature for views.

05/10/25
- Update engine to CECS refactor.
- Update engine to use CHDS vector.
- Reimplement broad phase collision detection. Separate moving vs moving and moving vs static entity checks.
  This enables an optimisation of only checking past the outer loop entity for the moving vs moving. Note, this 
  required the CECS implementation of 'exclude' for views.

06/10/25
- Minor refactors and updates (added Vector_clear, Vector_resize) to CHDS to make engine code cleaner.


TODOS:
- Refactor PointLight position to be a Transform component so the physics system can update it?
- Reimplement shadows.
